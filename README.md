SIMPLE SINGLE TRANSISTOR AUDIO AMPLIFIER CIRCUIT

If you want to built simple audio amplifier without messy components then you can construct simple single transistor audio amplifier circuit using BC847 and Resistor, Capacitor. This circuit can drive 8 ohm loud speaker and produce considerable sound. Apply 9 Volt DC supply for better result.



Construction & Working

To construct Amplifier circuit start with Transistor BC 847 and Connect proper bias to Collector, Base and Emitter terminals, For the first circuit Loud speaker is directly connected to the transistor collector terminal and for Preamplifier circuit speaker connected through coupling capacitor C2.

Input Audio signal for the first circuit is applied to the BC 847 base through Capacitor C1 (100ÂµF) and Collector coupled Resistor R1 hence the enough Audio signal and bias above cutoff voltage is constantly present at Base terminal of BC 847 and amplify the input signal near to peak Vcc.

 

COMPANENTS:

-BC847 TRANSISTOR

-2.2K RESISTOR

-100uF CAPASITOR

-1X2 FEMALE CONNECTOR
